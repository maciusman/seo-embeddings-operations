# Basic Netlify configuration file.
# This configuration assumes you might use Netlify for a static landing page
# or as a frontend that interacts with an externally hosted Streamlit application.
# Deploying a full, stateful Streamlit application directly on Netlify's
# standard infrastructure can be complex.

[build]
  # Command to build your static site (if you have one).
  # If you only have the Streamlit app in this repo and host it elsewhere,
  # you might not need a complex build command here unless you're also
  # building a landing page from this repo.
  command = "echo 'Optional: Add your static site build command here (e.g., npm run build, hugo, etc.)'"

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets from your build.
  # This is typically 'public', 'dist', '_site', 'build', etc., depending on your static site generator.
  # If you're just using Netlify to manage a domain and redirect, this might be less relevant
  # or point to a very simple placeholder page.
  publish = "static_landing_page/" # Create this directory with an index.html if you need a landing page

[dev]
  # If you use `netlify dev` locally, this can proxy to your Streamlit app
  # command = "streamlit run app.py" # If app.py is at the root of seo_app/
  # port = 8501 # Default Streamlit port

# Example: Redirect a path on your Netlify site to your externally hosted Streamlit app.
# Un-comment and update if you use this pattern.
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/app/*"  # Path on your Netlify site
#   to = "YOUR_EXTERNAL_STREAMLIT_APP_URL/:splat"  # URL of your deployed Streamlit app
#   status = 200  # Use 200 for proxying (URL masking), or 301/302 for actual redirect
#   force = true # Optional: ensures this rule is applied even if a file exists at the 'from' path

# If you were to use Netlify Functions for the Python backend (re-architecting the app):
# [functions]
#   directory = "netlify/functions" # Folder where your serverless functions would live

# Note on deploying Streamlit directly to Netlify:
# As of late 2023/early 2024, Netlify's primary strength is static sites and serverless functions.
# While they offer Python runtime for functions and are expanding web app support,
# a full Streamlit app (which is a running Python server) is often better suited for platforms
# like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, Google Cloud Run, AWS ECS, etc.
# If Netlify introduces more direct support for Python web servers like Streamlit,
# this configuration would need to be updated according to their guidelines.
