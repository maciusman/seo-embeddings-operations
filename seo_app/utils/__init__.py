# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty or contain package-level initializations.

# Optionally, you could import modules here to make them available
# directly from the package, e.g.:
# from . import crawler_logic
# from . import embedder_logic
# etc.
# However, for this project, explicit imports like `from utils.crawler_logic import ...`
# are used in app.py, so this __init__.py can remain simple.
